Welcome
============================

The Humanitarian Questions project is a structured repository where problem domains within the humanitarian sector are documented. This project aims to capture the problems that different humanitarian actors face in their work, to help organizations such as MapAction develop more appropriate solutions. 

We are committed to developing this material collaboratively, and so encourage feedback and contributions from anyone engaged within the humanitarian sector.
