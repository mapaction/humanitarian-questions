Frequently Asked Questions
=======================

#### What is the overall objective of this work? 

This book is intended to provide a structured exploration into the needs of actors who are working in the humanitarian sector. For this exploration to accurately reflect the needs of such a diverse sector, our hope is to engage with a wide range of individuals, organizations, and communities who can provide feedback and contribute content. 

The longer term goal is for this work to inform technical support organizations, such as MapAction. We hope that the insights from this work can help MapAction and others in their efforts to leverage data and technology to create products and services that support the humanitarian sector. 

We firmly believe that all technical solutions should be grounded in real-world needs, and intend for this work to help bridge the gap between humanitarian actors and technical organizations.
